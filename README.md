## Introduction
The FashionMNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixels, each representing one of 10 fashion categories. The goal of this project is to build a CNN model to accurately classify these images.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 test images

Each image is associated with a label from 10 classes:
1. T-shirt/top
2. Trouser
3. Pullover
4. Dress
5. Coat
6. Sandal
7. Shirt
8. Sneaker
9. Bag
10. Ankle boot

## Model Architecture
The model architecture includes multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. Dropout is used to prevent overfitting.

## Installation
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fashionmnist-cnn.git
    cd fashionmnist-cnn
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To train the model, use the following command:
```bash
python train.py
